- [x] Support multiple configuration files (check everything upwards from $PWD until the home directory is hit.  Always parse `~/.leaderrc`)
- [x] Tests, because prototyping is basically done now and I don't want to throw away the prototype (it works too well)
- [ ] Allow navigation to a previous menu using backspace, up, ctrl-b and left
- [x] Sort menu entries alphabetically
- [ ] Integration with common build tools to autogenerate parts of `.leaderrc`
- [x] Fix running interactive commands
- [ ] Add looping keys, i.e. if `a b` is set to looping, one can press `a b b b b` ad inifinitum to keep running the command bound to `a b`
- [x] Run all commands in the shell by default (default to `bash`, allow configuration in `.leaderrc`)
- [ ] Allow dynamic generation of menus (e.g. from a list of git branches)

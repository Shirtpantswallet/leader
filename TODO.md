- [x] Support multiple configuration files (check everything upwards from $PWD until the home directory is hit.  Always parse `~/.leaderrc`)
- [ ] Tests, because prototyping is basically done now and I don't want to throw away the prototype (it works too well)
- [x] Allow navigation to a previous menu using backspace, up, ctrl-b and left
- [x] Sort menu entries alphabetically
- [ ] Integration with common build tools to autogenerate parts of `.leaderrc`
- [x] Fix running interactive commands
